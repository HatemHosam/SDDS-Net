Space and Depth Encoder-Decoder Architectures for Real-Time Separate and Simultaneous Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation

requirements: <br />
Tensorflow '2.5.0' <br />
opencv '4.5.1' <br />
Numpy '1.19.5' <br />

The scripts provided are for models evaluation on CITYSCAPES and NYU depth V2 benchmarks.<br />

Weights files are available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1tviXcOM7ToxNjL1CbztsxVqs70l6adqY <br />

NYU depth V2 groudtruth depth maps and semantic segmentation maps are saved in sepcial formats for easier use with the provided code, they are available at this link: <br />
